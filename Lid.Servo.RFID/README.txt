This is the Arduino Code I curated to implement an Arduino Rc522 RFID module and the sg90 Arduino servo. 
I soldered the RFID module and servo connectors to an Arduino Nano
I also soldered on a 9v battery connector to the Nano so I can have the box run off a 9v battery.
Using super glue I conencted the Small Pin to the lid  of the box and the long arm connected to that. I used small wire pieces to secure the arms together. 
Be aware that different locations of the sg90 servo in the box will give different lifting strengths. 
I used a random pouch I had found to hold all of the electrical hardware including the module. 
Once the chip was placed in my handcarved heart I scan it over the bag and that allows the lid to open up.

My original plan for the hardware was to secure it in the lid, in a cutout I had made. But when the hardware was in the lid the sg90 servo was not strong enough or my angles
were not correct to provide enough strength to lift the heavier lid.
